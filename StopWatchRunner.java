/*
   A component that acts as a simple stop-watch.  When the user clicks
   on it, this component starts timing.  When the user clicks again,
   it displays the time between the two clicks.  Clicking a third time
   starts another timer, etc.  While it is timing, the label just
   displays the whole number of seconds since the timer was started.
